        <p class="lead">The Mungere School is the first middle and high school available to kids in the rural community of Mungere, Tanzania. Every year more than 200 families apply for one of the 30-40 available spots in the incoming class.
        When completed, The Mungere Campus will serve over 300 students each year, with students in grades 6-12.

        <br/>
        <p><strong>THE AVERAGE SCHOOL LACKS THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE STUDENTS</strong></p>
        <p>In Tanzania, secondary schools have incredibly high student-to-teacher ratios, teachers must utilize outdated books and learning materials, and facilities are limited. All formal exams in Tanzania are given in English, but many private secondary schools still teach in Swahili, due to teacher shortages and lack of proficiency.</p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>STILL THE AVERAGE FAMILY CAN'T AFFORD TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL</strong></p>
        <p>
        While elementary school in Tanzania is free, middle and high school costs about USD $500 per year, making it highly cost prohibitive when the average family income is roughly USD $530 per year. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm-6">
       <p>Even when families make great sacrifices to send a child to school, there is no guarantee of the quality of education. For students living in rural areas, attending middle or high school usually means traveling great distances daily, which can be both dangerous and exhausting.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p><strong>AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE</strong></p>
        <p>Families invest only USD $15 per year total to cover their child's entire education. While their financial contribution doesn't cover all expenses, it pays for operating costs at the school, solidifying each family's commitment. The school is centrally located within the village, protecting students from the vulnerability of travel and giving them much-needed time to study.</p>
        <br/>

        <p><strong>SOMETIMES IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE</strong></p>
        <p>The Parent Action Committee as well as the local tribal government are actively involved with the school. Community meetings are held regularly to share ideas and solve problems in a cohesive partnership.</p>

            <li>• Our teachers hold advanced degrees and lend local and cultural perspectives. Our teachers have come from from China, Ireland, the United States, Tanzania, Scotland, England, Mexico and Australia to donate their time and talents. All teachers have completed an ESL, CELTA or TESOL training. </li>
            <li>• Mungere students consistently score in the top quarter of schools in the region and in the top 3 in the district (out of 23 schools) on government-issued tests.</li>
            <li>• The Tanzania Ministry of Education has recognized Red Sweater Project as a successful school model that gets positive results.

              AN ATMOSPHERE THAT PROMOTES GENDER EQUALITY</strong></p>
            <li>• We level the playing field for boys and girls, whether it's in the classroom, on an athletic field or on a debate stage. This approach builds the confidence of female students and teaches all students that everyone has strengths that are not defined or limited by gender. </li>

            <li>• Two balanced meals are served each day, supplemented with fresh organic vegetables from the school garden. </li>
            <li>• Gas burners eliminate the school's need for firewood, which would contribute to deforestation.</li>

              <li>• Promotes gender equality on campus. Ninth grade student Tasiana Kabuka is a prime example.

        <h2>ABOUT TANZANIA, EAST AFRICA</h2>
        <p>
          Tanzania is an East African country known for its beautiful wilderness areas. They include the Serengeti National Park, a safari mecca populated by the “big five” game (elephant, lion, leopard, buffalo, rhino), and Kilimanjaro National Park, home to Africa’s highest mountain. Offshore lie the lush tropical islands of Zanzibar and Mafia Marine Park.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          The Mungere School is located 3 hours from Kilimanjaro airport, next to the great rift wall. Swahili is the national language of Tanzania, but by the time students graduate from Mungere, they are trilingual, speaking English, Swahili and their native tribal tongue such as Kimasai, Kirangi or Kichagga.
