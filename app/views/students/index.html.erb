				<h2>SPONSOR A STUDENT</h2>
        <h5><strong>$125 per month or $1,500 a year</strong></h5>
        <p>
          Sponsorship of a child equips them with everything they need to be successful in the classroom. It’s also an opportunity to build a lasting, meaningful friendship.
          Sponsors receive:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>• Hand written letters, and drawings from your student</li>
          <li>• A chance to exchange letters and stories, as well as to learn from a new friend</li>
        </ul>
        <h5><strong>Sponsored students receive:</strong></h5>
        <ul>
          <li>• A quality education with certified, experienced teachers</li>
          <li>• School supplies</li>
          <li>• A school uniform, including their red sweater!</li>
          <li>• Basic health and first-aid care including medicines to treat illness such as malaria, typhoid, and pneumonia. We want to keep our kids out of the hospital and in the classroom.</li>
          <li>• Access to extra-curricular activities including soccer, basketball, track, field trips and life-skills workshops</li>
          <li>• Two nutritious meals every school day with fresh vegetables from our organic garden</li>
          <li>• Safe drinking water</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>SPONSOR A GOOD CAUSE ON CAMPUS</h2>
      <h5><strong>Choose your gift amount and your cause</strong></h5>
      <p>
        There are several projects underway  at the Mungere Schools that need the support of sponsors like you. Commit to a yearly lump sum, or a monthly donation to support the cause of your choosing. Project sponsorships are year-long commitments with the option to continue sponsorship of the same project, or update your gift to go toward another project on campus.
