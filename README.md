# Red Sweater Project

This site allows teachers to apply for positions, sponsors to view and select students to sponsor, and an admin portal where upcoming fundraisers can be added and displayed and new students can be added for sponsorship.

For my week 1 code review I built out the root page where a viewer can see the students who are looking for sponsors.

Through the /events page users can see upcoming events. 

From /admin, an administrator can add/update/delete student profiles and events.
