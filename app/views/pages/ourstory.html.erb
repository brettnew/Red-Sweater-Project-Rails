      <h3>IT ALWAYS SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE UNTIL IT’S DONE</h3>

      <p class="lead">In 2005, when Ashley Holmer committed to teaching and coaching soccer for a year in a rural village in Tanzania, she had no idea it would be a life-altering move.</p>
      <p class="my-3">Over the course of the year, she lived and worked among the Maasai people. Living with no running water or electricity, she learned local customs, attended tribal rite of passage celebrations and ceremonies and became fluent in Swahili.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-8 offset-sm-2">

        <h2 style="line-height: 1.2"> “Why do I do this work? Because if you can, why wouldn’t you?”</h2>
        <hr>
      </div>
      <p class="my-3">She also saw the inequality between boys and girls, specifically in education. When 82% of Tanzanian families can’t afford school fees, sending girls to school isn’t a priority, it’s a burden. And many government schools aren’t a safe space for girls. A basic middle and high school education that’s a reality in many parts of the world, is still far from a dream here.</p>

      <p class="my-3">As a U.S. college all-star soccer player, Ashley quickly earned the respect of the males in the village on the pitch. Coaching and playing alongside boys where girls aren’t often allowed, she demonstrated how women could not only participate, but also compete.</p>

      <p class="my-3">Her leadership as a teacher and an athlete earned the respect of local leaders as well. By the end of 2005, she was asked to start a school in a nearby community. Coming from a family of educators, she understood the exponential benefits of a good education. She said yes.</p>

      <h3>WORKING TOWARD A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD </h3>
      <p class="my-3">The reality of a level playing field for girls in Tanzania and other East African countries was aspirational at best. But Ashley took on the community’s ask, raising funds for building and opening Orkeeswa, the first secondary school in Lashaine Village, in 2008.</p>

      <p class="my-3">And she knew one school wasn’t going to be enough. </p>

      <p class="my-3">There’s an entire generation of girls and boys being left behind in Tanzania. Providing middle and high school education and support to girls, especially those between the ages of 11 and 17, improves individual lives and families&mdash;and it has more impact in changing the next generation for the better than any other cause.</p>

      <p class="mt-3 mb-4">That’s why Ashley founded the Red Sweater Project in 2011, with the goal of putting as many students as possible into a school uniform, including their beloved red sweaters. In 2012, Red Sweater Project opened the Mungere School, which welcomes a new class of students each year. The organization is dedicated to developing quality, sustainable and accessible schools for East African children. And we’re just getting started.
