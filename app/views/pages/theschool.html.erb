      <p>The Mungere School is the first middle and high school available to kids in the rural community of Mungere, Tanzania. Every year upwards of 200 families apply for one of the 30 available spots in the incoming class. The Mungere campus serves over 240 students each year, with students in form 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (grades 6-12).

      <h5><strong>THE AVERAGE FAMILY CAN'T AFFORD TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO SCHOOL</strong></h5>
      <p>Primary school in Tanzania is free, but secondary school (middle and high school) costs about $500/year, when the average family only makes $530/year.</p>
      <p>Even when families make sacrifices to send a child to school, there is no gaurentee of the quality of education. All formal tests in Tanzania are in English, and it's not uncommon for private secondary schools to teach in Swahili due to teacher shortages. For students living in rural areas, going to school can also mean traveling great distances, which can be dangerous and exhausting.

      <h5><strong>AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE</strong></h5>
      <p>Families pay a $15/year tuition. While it doesn't cover all expenses, tuition pays for operating costs at the school, and solidifies each family's commitment to their child's education. The school is centrally located within the village, protecting students from the vulnerability of travel, and giving them more time to study.</p>
      <h5><strong>SOMETIMES IT REALLY DOES TAKE A VILLAGE</strong></h5>
      <p>The Parent Action commity as well as the local tribal government are activley involved with the school. Meetings are held regularly to share ideas, and problem solve as a community.</p>
